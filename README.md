# Eternis

Eternis is a multichain social media-ish platform that provides an alternative to traditional social media platforms. Eternis allows users to post content and interact with each other in an unstoppable and decentralized environment.

## How Eternis Works

Eternis uses a combination of existing solutions to achieve its functionality. The platform uses IPFS to host media content, The Graph to index chains, and smart contracts to enable on-chain logic. This architecture allows for a flexible and adaptable platform that can be customized to meet the needs of content creators and users.

## How Eternis Compares to LBRY

While Eternis shares some similarities with LBRY, there are several key differences between the two platforms. One major difference is that Eternis is multichain, while LBRY is limited to the LBRY blockchain. This allows for greater scalability and flexibility on the Eternis platform.

Additionally, Eternis uses The Graph to index chains, which provides a decentralized incentive mechanism for indexing and hosting the index. LBRY does not have this capability, which could potentially limit its ability to scale and grow over time.

Finally, Eternis allows for the creation of custom smart contracts with on-chain logic, while LBRY does not have this capability, enabling Eternis to provide a wide range of functionality to its users beyond what is available on LBRY.
