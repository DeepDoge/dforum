# Eternis

Eternis is a multichain social media-ish platform that provides an alternative to traditional social media platforms. Eternis allows users to post content and interact with each other in an unstoppable and decentralized environment.

## How Eternis Works

Eternis uses a combination of existing solutions to achieve its functionality. The platform uses IPFS to host front-end and content media, The Graph to index chains, and smart contracts to enable on-chain logic. This architecture allows for a flexible and adaptable platform that can be customized to meet the needs of content creators and users.

## How Eternis Compares to Mastodon

Mastodon is a decentralized social media platform that enables users to communicate with each other through different instances, with each instance being owned and operated by an entity. While Mastodon is decentralized in sense each instance can operate independently, it is not necessarily ownerless, as the instances still have control over the content and data hosted on their platforms.

While biggest difference between Mastadon and Eternis is that Mastadon is not based on blockchain technology. They have few more differences. Mastadon just uses a protocol that let's centerlized different platforms to talk with each-other and call it decenterlized. Eternis is designed to be ownerless from the ground up. This means no platform owns your content. They might make their own indexers, their own front-end and censor you that way, but your content always lives on the chain, and any other platform can index it.

In summary, while both Mastodon and Eternis are decentralized social media platforms, they have different architectures and priorities. Mastodon focuses on decentralized communication between different instances, while Eternis prioritizes an ownerless, decentralized environment for content creation and interaction, with greater flexibility and customization through smart contracts.

## How Eternis Compares to LBRY/Odysee

LBRY/Odysee is a decentralized content sharing and streaming platform that utilizes blockchain technology to enable content creators to monetize their work directly from their audience. Like Eternis, LBRY/Odysee is decentralized, but there are some key differences between the two platforms.

One of the major differences is that LBRY/Odysee is limited to the LBRY blockchain, while Eternis is multichain and can operate on multiple blockchains. This provides Eternis with greater scalability and flexibility, as it can leverage multiple chains for various purposes.

Another key difference is that while LBRY/Odysee utilizes blockchain technology to enable direct monetization for content creators, Eternis is designed to be an ownerless platform from the ground up. Eternis utilizes a combination of IPFS, The Graph, and smart contracts to host front-end and content media in a decentralized manner, with content creators retaining full ownership and control over their content.

Finally, Eternis provides greater customization and flexibility than LBRY/Odysee thanks to its smart contract-based architecture. Developers can create and deploy custom smart contracts with on-chain logic to enable a wide range of additional functionality, such as tipping and sponsored posts.

In summary, while both LBRY/Odysee and Eternis are decentralized content sharing platforms, they have different architectures and priorities. LBRY/Odysee is focused on enabling direct monetization for content creators on the LBRY blockchain, while Eternis prioritizes an ownerless, decentralized environment for content creation and interaction, with greater flexibility and customization through smart contracts.
