# Eternis

Eternis is an ownerless multi-chain platform that provides an environment for users to post content and interact with each other. It offers an alternative to traditional social media platforms by leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized protocols.

## How Eternis Works

Eternis uses a combination of existing technologies to achieve its functionality. The platform utilizes IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to host front-end and content media. It also utilizes The Graph to index chains and smart contracts to enable on-chain logic. This architecture allows for a flexible and customizable platform that meets the needs of content creators and users.

## Key Features

-   **Ownerless Platform:** Eternis is designed to be ownerless from the ground up. This means that no single entity or platform has control over the content posted by users. Your content always remains under your control on the blockchain and can be accessed by any platform.

-   **Multichain Support with Combined Timeline:** Eternis supports multiple blockchains, allowing users to post their content on different chains. However, all the posts from all chains are combined under one unified timeline. This means that you have the freedom to choose any blockchain without being restricted to a single network.

-   **Customization and Flexibility:** Eternis utilizes smart contracts, which enable the creation and deployment of custom on-chain logic. This allows for the implementation of various features such as tipping, sponsored posts, and more. Platform developers have the freedom to customize and enhance the functionality of Eternis.

## How Eternis Differs from Other Platforms

-   **Mastodon:** While both Eternis and Mastodon are social media platforms, they differ in their architectures and priorities. Mastodon operates through instances that host and own your content. It uses a protocol to enable communication between Mastodon instances and other fediverse platforms. In contrast, Eternis stores your content on the blockchain, ensuring that no single platform owns or controls it. If one platform censors your content, other platforms can still display it, providing a more resilient and censorship-resistant environment.

-   **LBRY/Odysee:** LBRY/Odysee and Eternis are both decentralized content sharing platforms with very similar designs. However, there are some distinct differences between the two. LBRY/Odysee is primarily based on the LBRY blockchain, while Eternis is a multichain platform that can operate on multiple blockchains. Eternis provides greater customization and flexibility through its smart contract-based architecture, allowing for the implementation of additional features and functionalities. Moreover, Eternis utilizes a combination of existing solutions, such as IPFS and The Graph, to achieve its functionality and has the flexibility to adapt and change them in the future. This ensures the platform's adaptability and future-proofing.

## Eternis by ChatGPT

"Eternis" is a groundbreaking decentralized platform designed to empower users with unparalleled control over their online experiences while fostering a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant, and user-driven community.

At its core, Eternis is a multi-chain, ownerless, and protocol-driven permanent database. It serves as a hub for users to post a wide variety of content, from text articles and multimedia, such as images and videos, to discussions and reviews. Users have the flexibility to choose whether to store content on-chain, benefiting from the immutability and security of blockchain technology, or to reference it from IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which optimizes the hosting of large files and multimedia.

One of Eternis' distinguishing features is its decentralized and censorship-resistant nature. It operates without any central authority, allowing users to interact directly with the platform according to established rules and protocols. Content moderation is not centralized, meaning that users have full control over their content exposure. Instead of muting or blocking, users have the ability to "unfollow" content creators, curating their own content feeds based on their preferences.

The platform encourages content discovery and personalization through a follow-based model. Users only see content from those they follow, making it easy to tailor their experience to their interests. Furthermore, users can rate content while replying, adding depth to discussions and promoting thoughtful engagement.

Eternis is highly accessible to both Web3 and Web2 users, with its main front-end hosted on IPFS and accessible through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for domain resolution. Users can also leverage IPFS gateways and JSON-RPC providers to access the platform even without deep knowledge of blockchain technology.

In addition to content sharing and interaction, Eternis incorporates a supporter model, allowing content creators to receive support from their audience. Supporters are counted, fostering a sense of community and recognition.

Overall, Eternis embodies the principles of decentralization, user control, and adaptability. It is a platform where users can communicate, share, and engage in a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment, and it encourages responsible behavior, content diversity, and user empowerment. As the platform continues to evolve, it will depend on the collaborative efforts and feedback of its community to shape the future of online interaction and content sharing.
