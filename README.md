# What is this?

Eternis is a multichain social media-ish platform that uses The Graph to index the chains and IPFS to host the front-end and media.<br/>
It has no owners or DAO, it's just a protocol, it's not on one contract but multiple, and you can make your own contracts with more on-chain logic. <br/>
It can be forked and changed. <br/>
Flexable, yet unchangable and unstopable. <br/>
It's made with [master-ts](https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts) UI building library.<br/>

# Goals

-   Timeline is gonna combine queries from multiple chains on the front-end
-   Basic post timeline, show posts of user on the user's page
-   Follow system (client side only for now), show combine posts from people you follow an home page
-   Search based on words in a post. (text content only), also have a prefix on the content type that indicates that its a string
-   Ability to follow search results
-   Somehow find out top daily, weekly, monthly yearly posts. No trends, because trends die while they are not suppose to die in favor of less popular but growing things, its based on the reply count
-   etc.
