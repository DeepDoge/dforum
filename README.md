# Goals

-   Timeline is gonna combine queries from multiple chains on the front-end
-   Basic post timeline, show posts of user on the user's page
-   Follow system (client side only for now), show combine posts from people you follow an home page
-   Search based on words in a post. (text content only), also have a prefix on the content type that indicates that its a string
-   Ability to follow search results
-   Somehow find out top daily, weekly, monthly yearly post. No trends, because trends die while they are not suppose to die in favor of less popular but growing things, its based on the reply count
-   etc.
